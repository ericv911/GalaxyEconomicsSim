    // Starlanes are stellarobject items.   Every starlane has a .from and .to property. Every stellarobject can  and should(!) have multiple starlanes.
    // Every starlane has a duplicate.  The From and To from one stellarobject and the reverse From and TO from the stellarobject on the other side.      
    // This is to ensure that calculations during the turn are kept minimal. If a ship or what enters a stellar object, the available destinations
    // do not need to be calcualated but are known. 
    // An  collection of starlanes independent of the stellar objects, with stellar objects as it's member, would result in extensive computations during the running of a turn.  
    // With the current setup, most of the computations and extra work are done during the phase of initialisation of all objects.
    // During the running of a turn, not much extra calculations are needed. Except when the mouse is clicked to determine the closest starlane. To highlighting the Starlane. 

    // IF a starlane is added to the collection, do it both ways. .From and .To for both stellarobjects.!!
