// a file used to generate the entities that control trade, orbital bodies, ships, stellar system, stellar lanes.
// these entities range from commercial enterprises, political governing bodies, independent entities, the player character etc etc.
// for now, each entity has only a few properties. It's Name, and an associated color for the stuff it controls.
// order of information = name, color red green blue
// each stellarsystem is owned by one of these identities. Find a way to represent this accurately on the map.  Perhaps a colored smudge behind the star.
