// new molecules can be made from combining existing resources.  It all depends on the oxidation state. 
// somehow all of the oxidation state of the elements have to be read from file to collection in memory. 
// should be resource specific. Make section in resource file that starts with total number of possible oxidation states, followed by the actual // possible oxidation states.  
// should look like this : .... 4, -2, -1 ,3, 4, ...

//indicating 4 oxidation states with values -2, -1, +3 and +4.
