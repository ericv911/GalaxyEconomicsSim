// Building types
//
// each orbital body can have a collection of buildings built on it.
// each building type is an abstraction for many buildings and people living there
// 1 farm built represents 100's of real life farms
// each building built on an orbital body can have a an associated tech level modifier, population change modifier, food change modifier and/or other as of yet to determine modifiers.

// Other properties are following, such as building upkeep per level. population needed to run // the building.  etc etc.
// Each type has bools   can it affect population, can it affect food,plus 2 associated modifiers
// Modifiers will be multiplied together. So a modifiers need to be higher than 0. A modifier > 1 will increase the result, a modifier < 1 will decrease it. 
// order of data is : Name (string), needsHabitabilitytoBuild(bool), hasTechLevel (bool), canResize(bool), canbeBuilt(bool), canModifyFood (bool), canModifyPopulation (bool), 
// FoodModifier(double), Populationmodifier(double), PopulationHousing(int), FoodStorage(int) % Chance of occuring at the beginning on a body (double)

// Farm modifies food production, can house people and needs people to operate. some farms are present at the beginning
// Housing only houses a certain number of people. some housing is present at the beginning
// Hopsital increases birth rates and decreases death rates. (more people born, less people die)
// Alien Ruins don't do anything. They are meant for technology discoveries and alien supply caches. They are distributed at the beginning
